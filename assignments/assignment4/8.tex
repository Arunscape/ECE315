A circular buffer can be created using the modulo feature of the eDMA, in which
the size of the queue is a power of 2. It is limited to a size of 0 bytes
(where the buffer is disabled) to maximum of 256 Kbytes. The SMOD and the DMOD 
field descriptors are used to specify the source and destination buffer sizes,
respectively. These are available in bits 15-12 and 11-8 in the DCRn field
descriptors. (where n is 0, 1, 2, or 3). The buffer base address will be located
on a boundary of the buffer size, and the value of the boundary is based on the
initial source/destination address. (Source for SMOD, destination for DMOD These
are in the SAR and DAR registers, respectively).
