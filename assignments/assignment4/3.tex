\begin{enumerate}
  \item lwIP is written in C, which is a highly portable language with broad
    compiler support for multiple platform targets
  \item lwIP is designed such that the software is partitioned between a generic
    TCP/IP stack core which is buffered with 3 adaptation layers
  \item the first adaptation layer deals with the hardware, it is a bunch of
    drivers which abstracts the hardware to make it appear the same since the
    same access functions are made available
  \item the second adaptation layer deals with varying operating systems. It
    makes very few assumptions about the operating system to allow for
    compatibility with a wide range of operating systems
  \item the third adaptation layer serves as an API which provides function
    calls that implement sockets for higher level applications
