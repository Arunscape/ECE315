When the data arrives out of order from the perspective of the receiver, it is
stored, and presented to the process in the correct order. 

Out-of-order packets are detected by the receiving networking hardware by
checking the sequence portion of the TCP header. This is a 32-bit field which
comes after first 32 bits. (That is, bits 32-63) in the header.
The purpose of the sequence field is store a number which allows the
bytes which are sent to be ordered. The starting number is agreed upon
when setting up the connection, and subsequent segments have an increasing
segment number in their respective header fields. 

If a later
segment arrives before the one which is expected, the receiver can hold on to it
while it waits for the next segment which it is expecting to arrive. Then, when
the correct segment arrives, the receiver can send an acknowledgements for the
segments received. (The acknowledgements are sent in the same order as the
sequence numbers)
