  Multiple Nonpreemptive Loops with Interrupts (cont’d)
• Advantages:
– Guaranteed minimum polling frequency for each
input or device
– Guaranteed maximum response time for polled
inputs and devices
– External events are handled promptly and
deterministically using hardware-triggered interrupts.
• Disadvantages:
– Some devices may be polled faster than necessary,
which is wasteful of the processor’s time.
– The one software thread has less cohesion because
it now handles more than one loop. A state variable
keeps track of the timer ISR calls and the active loop.

\subsection*{Similarities}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item both use harmonic intervals to move between different sections of code
  \item todo
\end{enumerate}\todo{}

\subsection*{Differences}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item separate blocks of code represented as a different loop vs. a different
    states
  \item polling peripherals (Multiple nonpreemptive loops) vs. tasks running at
    specified intervals.
\end{enumerate}
