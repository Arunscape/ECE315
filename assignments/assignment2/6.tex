%The bit period is \[\frac{1}{115200}\]

Calculating the error budget, \footnotemark
\[75\% \div 2 = 37.5\%\]
\[35\% \times 32 = 12\]
\footnotetext{Calculation is based off of this tutorial:
\url{http://www.eecs.umich.edu/courses/eecs373.w05/lecture/AN2141.pdf}}

So, \(\pm 12\) periods is the error budget, except for that the
clock and the received data stream are asynchronous and the falling edge of the
start bit could occur just after a 32x clock rising edge, or just before one but
without enough setup time to use it. So, the error budget is actually \(\pm
11\) periods.

The optimum sampling point for the stop bit is its bit-centre,
which is
\[32 \times (1~start~bit + 8~data~bits + 0.5~stop~bit) = 304 \]
receive clocks after the original falling edge of the start bit.

So, the allowable error is
\[\frac{11}{304} \times 1000000 = 36184.21053~ppm\]
