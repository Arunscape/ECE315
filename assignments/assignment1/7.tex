\begin{itemize}
  \item Most of MicroC/OS is written in standard ANSI-C. ANSI-C is a highly
    portable language.
  \item The features of MicroC/OS-II can be accessed using
    subroutine calls from applications written in C. 
  \item The software architecture of MicroC/OS was partitioned to hide
    machine dependencies within a relatively small and well-defined
    processor port. This means that a small amount of code needs to be changed
    to port the operating system to a new platform, therefore making it easier
    to port
  \item MicroC/OS does not make many assumptions about the hardware.
    There must be a CPU to execute compiled ANSI software, and
    a hardware timer resource to provide software-independent
    timing for use in functions with programmable real-time time delays.
