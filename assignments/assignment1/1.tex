\subsection*{Hard real-time vs. Soft real-time embedded systems}

\subsubsection*{Similarities}
\begin{itemize}
  \item With both, we want to avoid violating real-time constraints
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Differences}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Violations of real-time constraints are undesireable, but tolerated in
    soft real-time systems while in hard real-time systems, violations of
    real-time constraints are unacceptable
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection*{}
When selecting an implementation strategy, it is useful to distinguish between
hard and soft real-time systems because you want to select a strategy that is
appropriate. For example, you probably would not want a soft real-time embedded
system for an application that lives depend on, like a pacemaker or traffic
lights for example.
