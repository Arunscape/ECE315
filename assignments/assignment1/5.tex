A memory leak happens when a dynamic object is not freed after it is no longer
required. Even though the program no longer needs the object, it holds on to the
precious space in memory and does not allow for that space to be recycled to
allow new objects to take up that space. Left unchecked, the system will run out
of memory, degrade performance, and eventually cause system failure.
