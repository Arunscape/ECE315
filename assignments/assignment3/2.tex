The FEC 


The DMA 

If the system designer is expecting more bits to be sent than recieved, they may
choose to partition the FIFO buffer such that more space is allocated for
sending bits than receiving. Similarly, if more bits are expected to be received
than sent, then the FIFO buffer may be allocated such that the buffer for
receiving is larger. 

This decision would be implemented by loading the value


into an FEC register.
