A \textbf{duplex point-to-point link} is a point-to-point link that allows for
simultaneous communication in both directions. (A point-to-point link is a
dedicated connection between two communicating nodes, with one node at each end
of the link.)


A \textbf{fully connected topology} is a network topology where every node has a
dedicated link to every other node in the network, such that the number of
connections required is \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\), where n is the number of nodes in
the network.

A \textbf{collision} occurs when two devices on the same network attempt to
transmit data at the exact same time. As a result, the transmitted bits usually
end up being mangled, and have to be retransmitted.


A \textbf{crossover cable} is an ethernet cable used to connect two computing
devices of the same type together. One end is wired T-568A, while the other is
wired T-568B.


A \textbf{daisy-chain configuration} is a scheme where devices are connected
together in series. They can also be in a ring topology. It can be compared to a
string threaded through daisy flowers, where the daisies are devices, and the
string forms the connections between them. Similarly, a ring can also be formed
in this configuration.
