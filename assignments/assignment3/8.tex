Smaller packets have higher overhead. This should be considered when selecting
the maximum packet size. If the connection is unreliable, and packets tend to
get lost, then smaller packets are better. If the connection is more stable,
then a larger maximum packet size may be more desireable due to less
retransmissions, and less overhead. 

These values are comunicated during the handshake process. The sender will
advertise the maximum amount of data that can be sent before it must wait for an
acknowledgement from the receiver. The reciever will then manage flow control.

If window advertisement is not done, the reciever continually informs the sender
of how much data it is prepared to receive.
