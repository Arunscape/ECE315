\begin{enumerate}
  \item MAC determines which device can access the medium at one moment
  \item provides an abstraction for the physical layer to the other higher
    higher-level layers in the OSI model. 
  \item collision detection, resolution, and avoidance (like CSMA/CD and CSMA/CA
    for example). Also handles retransmission
  \item offers some protection against transmission errors, usually through
    frame check sequences
  \item resolves addressing of destination stations
  \item controls access to the PHY
\end{enumerate}

Compared to the PHY, the MAC layer operates at one layer above the PHY in the
OSI model. Additionally, the physical layer does not handle error detection and
correction. It does not determine which device can access the medium either. The
physical layer transmits raw bits, instead of data frames. It is an interface to
the transmission medium, while the MAC layer is an interface to the physical
layer.
