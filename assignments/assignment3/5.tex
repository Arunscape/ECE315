\section{}
There are two different systems of priorities because tasks and hardware
interrupts are meant to behave very differently from each other. Hardware
interrupts usually are meant to interrupt tasks that are currently running, so
that the system can react in real-time to external events, while tasks generally
have lower priority. For example, waking up the system from a low-power state
happens with a hardware interrupt, and stops the idle task from running. This is
an example of the two different systems interacting. These
two systems can also interact with each other when a task requires a hardware
interrupt to continue execution. For example, waiting on a hardware timer, or an
I/O request.
