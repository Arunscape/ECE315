IP provides only an unreliable and connectionless service using its own node
addressing scheme even if at least some of the underlying networks might already
provide reliable communication or a large number of unique addresses for every
node because the priority is compatibility between the existing networks. Not
all networks connected to the internet are reliable. Not all of them have a very
large number of unique addresses for every node.
