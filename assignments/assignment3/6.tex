IP provides only an unreliable and connectionless service using its own node
addressing scheme even if at least some of the underlying networks might already
provide reliable communication or a large number of unique addresses for every
node because the priority is compatibility between the existing networks. Not
all networks connected to the internet are reliable. Not all of them have a very
large number of unique addresses for every node. If a connection is made between
an unreliable network, and a reliable one, overall, the transmission is still
unrunreliable. Providing an only unreliable allows for greater compatibility
between the networks. It also allows for separation of concerns. If reliability
is required, or state information about the connection is required,
that can be provided by the higher level layers. For example, the TCP protocol
can be used to have a reliable connection. Similarly, IP using its own
addressing scheme allows for the upper layers to use their own addressing
schemes which allow for more options and compatibility for connections and
protocols.
