\subsection*{Advantages}
\begin{itemize}
  \item All ethernet frames will fit in the buffer
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{When would it be more appropriate to choose a single threaded
  bare-metal architecture}

\begin{itemize}
  \item THe FEC would accept frames that are larger than the ethernet standard
    and are potentially garbage
\end{itemize}
