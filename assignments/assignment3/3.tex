\subsection*{Advantages}
\begin{itemize}
  \item when responsiveness is desired and fast response times are needed
  \item allows the programmer to concentrate on the requirements of a
    specific task without worrying about the effect it has on the system and
    other tasks
  \item better modularity, making it easier to maintain and extend the code
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{When would it be more appropriate to choose a single threaded
  bare-metal architecture}

\begin{itemize}
  \item when simplicity is desired in the source code and deemed more important
    than responsiveness. For example, when prototyping
  \item when there are only a few, not complicated tasks
  \item if the overhead of multitasking is too high. For example, multitasking
    environments require more memory, and context switching might take too much
    time. Also, debugging becomes more difficult due to complex interactions,
    and control of shared resources
  \item if efficient operation with the simplest hardware possible is desired
\end{itemize}
