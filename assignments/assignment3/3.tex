\subsection*{Advantages}
\begin{itemize}
  \item A receive interrupt will always happen when a packet is received,
    meaning no ethernet packets would be ignored by the system
  \item If the EMRBR value was smaller, ethernet frames that are longer than
    expected will be dropped. With a larger EMRBR value, this is not a problem.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Disadvantages}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The FEC would accept frames that are larger than the ethernet standard,
    if the value in the EMRBR register is too big which could result in garbage
    data being read
  \item 
\end{itemize}
